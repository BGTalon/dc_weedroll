This is a simple weed rolling script to go with the custom weed roll animation and props.
oxlib is a dependency for this https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib

You need to have the Free Weed Pack(https://github.com/DCCustomz/DC-Weed-Pack-One) 
& also the The Everyday Animations Pack(https://dc-customs.tebex.io/category/animations)
To use the props and animations how they are. But you can always edit to use your own animations and props as well

If you need any help just make a ticket in discord and we can get it figured out https://discord.gg/dccustomz
